              <p>The Brown Card swiping interface has a card slot, three colored lights, and an arrow.
              <br><br>The lights indicate whether the interface is ready for a swipe, and if a swipe is successfull or unsuccessfull.
              <br><br>These interfaces can be found all over campus, most commonly on residential buildings to allow students to enter their dorms.</p>
              <br><h3>Immediately, it is unclear which direction the card is supposed to be facing when you swipe it.</h3>

              <h3>Observations</h3>
              <p>
              Users rarely have trouble with this interface, most of the time they are able to get the door opened on their first swipe. In the instance the first swipe is not successful, often times users will swipe their card multiple times in response to ensure it is read before attempting to open the door again. I didn't notice anyone who got stuck and was unable to open the door due to any issues (interface or card related). In my observations, everyone who went to use the interface was able to get in to the building in less than 10 seconds. Although the interface works, it is still not the most intuitive and could be designed better.

              <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">Questions</h3>
              <p style="font-size: 15px;">
              1. How do you decide which direction to you swipe your card? Does the interface do a good job of showing this?<br>
              2. How many times do you swipe your card? Just once? Which direction? Top to bottom?<br>
              3. Do you feel there is a long delay from when you swipe to when the door is openable?<br>
              4. How often do you have to re-swipe because your card is not read?<br>
              5. Does it bother you that your card must be swiped as opposed to being tapped? Are there some circumstances where it is difficult to swipe your card?

              <p>
                - People know which direction to swipe not because of the interface, but based off of long term use and remembering the correct orientation to use.<br>
                - Users often swipe their cards multiple times before receiving any feedback to speed up the process of entering buildings; if one were to swipe, then wait to see if it works, then swipe again, that waiting time would be increased.<br>
                - I usually have to swipe my card more than once because it is not read the first time.<br>
                - The delay after swiping the card is not significant, and when you consider the time it takes to physically move from the swipe interface to actually grab and open the door, you aren’t slowed down at all.<br>
                - It would be much nicer to have a card that isn’t read via magnetic strip/swipe, like maybe an RFID card that just requires it to be tapped on the reader; this would prevent you from having to remove the card from any sleeve/you might not even have to take it out of your phone case or wallet.<br>

                1. The user in this empathy map is a junior at Brown who's been living in residence halls with the common “Software House” swipe interfaces for years, so they should be well versed with this interface.<br>
                2. The problems this persona faces include a lack of intuitive signage depicting the proper use and the lack of feedback indicating when it is not used the proper way, but they have experience which helps mediate these problems.<br>
                3. Brown students often face issues (although not very severe in the scale of things) with the swipe interfaces, often requiring them to attempt to swipe again, either slower or with the card facing a different way.<br><br>

                1. The user in this empathy map is a freshman at Brown who lives in a residence hall with the common “Software House” swipe interfaces, and they also keep their Brown Card inside a sleeve attached to a lanyard.<br>
                2. The problems this persona faces include a lack of intuitive signage depicting the proper use, the lack of feedback indicating when it is not used the proper way, a lack of experience using this interface, and having to remove their card from the sleeve.<br>
                3. This Brown student keeps their card in a sleeve as some do, but will face more issues with the swipe interfaces as a result of this and their lack of experience.<br><br>
